If you prefer a video tutorial [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibtXXoMxaho&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6avBYxeBSwF48YhAnSn_sA4&index=2) will walk you through the below steps.

1. Go to the [Discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
1. Click the New Application button.
1. Name your application. This is different than the name of your bot. If the bot has a specific use name it something related to that.
1. Navigate to the Bot page. You should see a link on the left hand side.
1. Click Add Bot.
1. Give it a username. This will appear in Discord.
1. Navigate to the OAuth page. You should see a link on the left hand side.
1. Select the bot checkbox in the Scopes section.
1. Select the bot permissions you think you will need. **Do not just select administrator**. If you don't know what permissions you will need you can start off with just "Send Messages".
1. Copy the link and send to Stephen.
