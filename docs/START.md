# Getting Started

Make sure you [setup a discord bot](SETUP.md) before doing these steps.

1. Clone the repository to your computer using the Github desktop app.
1. Copy the `.env.example` file and name it `.env`.
1. Go to the [Discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
1. Click on your bot application.
1. Click the bot link on the left side of the page.
1. Copy the token.
1. In the `.env` file you made replace `"PUT_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"` with your token. You should leave the quotes around it.
1. Message Stephen for the channel ID and replace `"CHANNEL_ID"` with the channel ID. You should leave the quotes around it as well.
1. Open the project folder in terminal and run `npm install`.
1. Once that's finished run `npm run start` to start the bot.
1. Make a new branch and do all your work on a branch.
